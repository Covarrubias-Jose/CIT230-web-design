                    <h2 id="description">Site Description</h2>
                    <p>Now days we can learn just about anything online, specially on You Tube, if you don’t know how to do something, just search for it on You Tube and most likely that you will find a video teaching or showing how to do it. On this website you can find tutorials on how to do many things, for now it will be on things that I have done myself, so I can record videos and show others how to do things, for example; working with Excel, PowerPoint, Android, IMac, Windows 10, few car repairs and other stuff. The website will be a compilation of tutorials that others may find useful. Videos will be uploaded periodically to cover more topics of visitor’s interests.
